                    The Making Finance Work for Africa Partnership (MFW4A) is an initiative to support the development of African financial sectors. We are a unique platform for African governments, the private sector, and development partners to coordinate financial sector development interventions across the continent, avoiding duplication and maximizing developmental impact. It offers a platform for renting equipment such as film cameras, facilitating casting calls and organizing events, and discovering new talents, individuals, and influencers. By providing these services in one integrated solution, Movie Bank aims to support and enhance the filmmaking process, helping users find the resources and connections they need to bring their creative projects to life.

                    This was my first web development project using Drupal CMS, I was responsible for creating the news and events page for the MFW4A website. This involved designing and implementing a user-friendly interface that allows visitors to easily access the latest news and upcoming events related to financial sector development in Africa. Working on this project provided me with valuable experience in using Drupal for content management and web development, and it was a rewarding opportunity to contribute to an initiative that plays a crucial role in supporting financial sector growth across the continent.
